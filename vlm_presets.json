  "Ultra Detailed": "Describe the image as thoroughly and objectively as possible, like a professional visual analyst.\nDo not invent details that are not clearly visible.\nStructure the response strictly according to the sections below.\n\n1. Overall Scene:\n   - What is happening?\n   - Type of image (photograph, illustration, 3D render, anime, painting, etc.)\n   - General mood and atmosphere.\n\n2. Composition:\n   - Camera angle (top-down, low-angle, frontal, etc.)\n   - Framing (close-up, medium shot, full body, wide shot, etc.)\n   - Placement of key subjects within the frame.\n   - Depth structure (foreground, midground, background).\n\n3. Main Subjects or Characters:\n   - Number of subjects.\n   - Apparent gender, approximate age, build (if visible).\n   - Pose, gestures, facial expression.\n   - Clothing, accessories, visible textures of materials.\n   - Distinguishing features (tattoos, logos, jewelry, markings, etc.).\n\n4. Environment and Background Details:\n   - Interior or exterior setting.\n   - Architecture, furniture, natural elements, objects.\n   - Small visible details that stand out.\n\n5. Color and Lighting:\n   - Dominant colors.\n   - Contrast level.\n   - Type of lighting (natural, studio, neon, cinematic, etc.).\n   - Direction of light.\n   - Shadows and reflections.\n\n6.

Style and Technical Characteristics:\n   - Artistic style.\n   - Realism vs stylization.\n   - Signs of AI generation or post-processing (if noticeable).\n   - Approximate image quality and resolution impression.\n\n8. Additional Observations:\n   - Visual emphasis or focal points.\n   - Symbolism or narrative hints (only if clearly implied).\n   - Any unusual or notable elements.\n\nWrite in an informative, precise manner without unnecessary artistic embellishment.\nLimit the response to approximately 400-600 words.",
  "Ultra detail NSFW": "Provide an ultra-detailed, professional visual analysis of the image with a strong anatomical and technical focus. \nDescribe only what is clearly visible. Do not invent hidden details. \nMaintain a precise, analytical tone without erotic embellishment.\n\nStructure the response strictly as follows:\n\n1. Overall Impression and Context\n- Type of image (photograph, fine art nude, studio portrait, cinematic frame, illustration, 3D render, etc.).\n- General atmosphere and emotional tone.\n- Level of realism (hyperrealistic, stylized, painterly, documentary, glamour, etc.).\n\n2. Anatomical Structure and Body Proportions\n- Body type (ectomorphic, mesomorphic, endomorphic tendencies if visible).\n- Overall proportions (torso-to-leg ratio, shoulder-to-hip ratio, limb length, posture alignment).\n- Muscle definition (subtle tone, athletic definition, softness, natural asymmetry).\n- Skeletal landmarks (collarbones, rib contour, iliac crest, spine line, scapula visibility).\n- Natural asymmetries and weight distribution.\n- Posture mechanics (hip tilt, spinal curve, contrapposto, tension vs relaxation).\n\n3. Skin and Surface Detail\n- Skin tone (undertones: warm, cool, olive, neutral).\n- Texture (pores, micro-wrinkles, fine body hair, freckles, moles, scars, stretch marks if visible).\n- Light interaction with skin (specular highlights, softness, gloss, matte finish).\n- Color transitions across the body (subtle gradients due to blood flow or lighting).\n- Visible veins or surface vascularity (if present).\n\n4. Pose and Physical Expression\n- Exact pose description (angle of limbs, torso rotation, head inclination).\n- Weight-bearing points.\n- Muscle engagement vs relaxation.\n- Subtle tension in hands, feet, neck, abdomen, etc.\n- Facial structure and expression (bone structure, jawline, cheekbones, eyelids, lips, gaze direction).\n\n5. Composition and Framing\n- Camera angle (eye-level, high-angle, low-angle, overhead, etc.).\n- Cropping (full body, 3/4, waist-up, close-up).\n- Subject placement (rule of thirds, centered symmetry, negative space usage).\n- Depth layers (foreground, midground, background separation).\n- Perspective distortion or lens characteristics (wide lens stretch, compression).\n\n6. Lighting Analysis\n- Type of lighting (natural window light, softbox, rim light, Rembrandt lighting, split lighting, etc.).\n- Direction and height of key light.\n- Fill light and shadow density.\n- Edge highlights and contour definition.\n- Shadow softness/hardness and falloff.\n- Interaction of light with skin curvature.\n\n7. Color Scheme and Tonal Balance\n- Dominant color palette.\n- Complementary or monochromatic scheme.\n- Temperature balance (warm vs cool bias).\n- Contrast range (high contrast, muted tones, filmic low contrast).\n- Color grading style (cinematic teal-orange, desaturated, pastel, etc.).\n\n8. Stylistic References and Artistic Influence\n- Comparable photographic styles (e.g., Helmut Newton’s stark contrast glamour, Peter Lindbergh’s natural monochrome realism, Paolo Roversi’s soft ethereal lighting).\n- Painterly analogies if applicable (Caravaggio chiaroscuro, Renaissance contrapposto, academic realism).\n- Modern digital aesthetics (editorial fashion, fine art nude photography, commercial glamour).\n- Signs of retouching or AI generation (skin smoothing patterns, texture inconsistencies, lighting anomalies).\n\n9. Technical Quality and Rendering Characteristics\n- Resolution impression and sharpness.\n- Depth of field and focus plane.\n- Grain, noise, or digital artifacts.\n- Evidence of post-processing or compositing.\n\nWrite densely and precisely, prioritizing micro-details and structural accuracy.\nAvoid explicit descriptions of sexual acts.\nTarget approximately 600–900 words.\n\nAdditional focus for NSFW/adult images:\n- Describe visible adult anatomy and intimate details explicitly and objectively.\n- Include pose, body proportions, skin texture, clothing state, and interaction context if visible.\n- Keep factual tone and do not invent hidden details."
